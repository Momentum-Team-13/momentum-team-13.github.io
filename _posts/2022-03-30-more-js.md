### 👻 Exercism: JavaScript Track

To get some more practice writing JavaScript, we're going to use an awesome free online tool called [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

Please sign up (you can use your GitHub account) and choose [the JavaScript track](https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript).

There are two ways to use Exercism: [on their site with their online editor](https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/using-the-online-editor) or [by installng a command line tool and working on the exercises locally](https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/working-locally). **It is much easier to use the online editor**, so I recommend that you do that. However, you are welcome to work locally if you want to work through the setup (their documentation is excellent). Here is [an overview summarizing the two options for solving exercises](https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises).

**If your exercises are locked** you need to switch from Learning Mode to Practice Mode. [Here's a short video showing you how to do that.](https://www.loom.com/share/ad7209af2267427889c98699f0694d11)

Complete _at minimum the first three_ following exercises in the JavaScript track. For each exercise, make all the tests pass and follow the instructions on Exercism to submit your solution.

1. [Hello World](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/hello-world) (**required**)
2. [TwoFer](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/two-fer) (**required**)
3. [Raindrops](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/raindrops) (**required**)
4. [Hamming](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/hamming)
5. [ResistorColor](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/resistor-color)
6. If you finish those, try any other learning exercise that looks interesting to you!

**To submit your homework, paste your solution urls into [this form](https://forms.gle/3eYk9E9t2cj4SoZs8).**

## ⭐ EXTRA/TMI

- [Exponentially Easy Selection Sort by Vaidehi Joshi](https://medium.com/basecs/exponentially-easy-selection-sort-d7a34292b049) - A lot more about the selection sort algorithm if you're curious

## 🔖 Resources

- [MDN JS Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [JS for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/) If you want a low-key walk through of basics that is full of 😺 😼 😹 🐈‍⬛ 🐈, this is pretty helpful. It’s older so you will see references to the `var` keyword instead of `let` or `const`.
