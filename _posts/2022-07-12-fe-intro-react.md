## 🎯 Project: React Tutorial

[Beginner's Guide to React Tutorial](https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react-2020/). This is a really friendly total beginner tutorial that will show you the most modern way to build React apps.

[This link will create an empty repo on GitHub that you can use to push your tutorial code to.](https://classroom.github.com/a/YDIyNl-y)

If you finish this and want to keep going, try one of these other tutorials:

- [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) - video-driven, intense and very complete
- [The official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) - classic, official. Uses class-based components, which are a bit older, but still widely used
- [Dave Ceddia's React tutorial](https://daveceddia.com/react-getting-started-tutorial/) - very long, very comprehensive, but still pretty accessible
