### ⭐️ EXTRA/TMI

Layout techniques for CSS include a lot of options other than flexbox. This reference summarizes them and gives you a good sense of other things you might see.

A popular alternative to flexbox for layout is called "grid", also built into CSS. With flexbox you choose to line up your boxes either vertically or horizontally, but with grid you can specify both horizontal and vertical arrangement in the same box.

Jen Simmons is a former Mozilla developer and educator with a great series on YouTube to teach you css layout best practices using grid and flexbox.

Before we had flexbox or grid built into CSS, we relied on floats for layout. You should **not** be using floats to lay out your pages, but you may still see them in other people's code. Because of that, you may want to familiarize yourself at some point.
