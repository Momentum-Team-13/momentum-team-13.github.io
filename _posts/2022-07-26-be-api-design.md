## üóìÔ∏è Today's Topics

- Models for your collaborative project
- Designing the urls you need
- Review permissions & CORS

## üéØ Project

Today you should have your models nailed down and be able to work with them in the admin and the shell -- that is, you can save them to the database and retrieve them, and all the relationships work properly.

You should have a plan **written down** for at least the basic set of urls that your front-end will need. You may make changes to this as you go, but you need a place to begin.

When creating your list of endpoints, remember: **only build what you need.**

- What lists or collections of data will you need to return? (There are probably some you can omit.)
- What single resources will you need to provide?
- What HTTP methods will you need to support for each endpoint? (There are probably some you don't need.)
- Which routes will need the user to be authenticated and which do not require authentication?
- Will you need to restrict any actions at the object level? For example, you'll probably want to make sure that only the owner of a resource can make changes to it, or add associated objects.

### By Friday

Your API should...

- be returning JSON for GET requests for questions and answers / cards and friends
- be able to accept POST requests to create questions and answers / cards and friends
