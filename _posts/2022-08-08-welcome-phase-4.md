tags: phase-4 agile
---

The past few months have prepared you to take on the challenge ahead in these next four weeks. You may not _feel_ ready, but you ARE.

Your goal in this phase is to design and build a real-world software product, working collaboratively on a small team using agile development practices and all the tools you've already learned, and some you will learn as you go.

At the end of the phase, your team will present your product to an audience of local tech professionals, hiring partners, and the Momentum community.

The experience of working on a team during this phase and the product you build will form the foundation for your job search. _The people skills you'll use will be just as important as the technical skills!_

**You will not begin writing code for your project until all the planning is done.** Ideally your team will be ready to write code by Thursday or Friday of this week.

## Today's topics

- What is agile development?
- Forming final project groups
- Brainstorming product ideas

## ‚úÖ TODO this morning

1. üïõ BY NOON: [Make sure you have filled out this survey](https://forms.gle/FPktj9eLLugeuEeu8) about your interests and intentions for Phase 4 (it's the same one I shared last Friday).
2. üåü Read this post for an engineer's perspective on an approach to building software that parallels almost precisely the approach we take in Phase 4: [How we use "ship small" to rapidly build new features at GitHub](https://dev.to/mscccc/how-we-use-ship-small-to-rapidly-build-new-features-at-github-5cl9)
3. üíú [Are you a Chaos Muppet or an Order Muppet? Read this post and **post your personal findings in Slack üëÄ**.](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/06/chaos-theory.html)

## ‚úÖ TODO this afternoon

1. **Create a Slack channel** (not a thread) and add team members and instructors to it.
2. **Create a team charter** with your team and pin or bookmark it in your team's Slack channel. There are resources below to help you with this task.
3. Brainstorm ideas for your final project with your team, and **be ready to pitch one or two ideas tomorrow morning**.
