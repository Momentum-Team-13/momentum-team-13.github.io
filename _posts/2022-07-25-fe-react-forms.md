## ðŸŽ¯ Collaborative Project

Begin talking to your teammates and planning the team project. You should have detailed wireframes, an idea of user flow (how your user interacts with your UI), and a plan for components done by tomorrow.

Start with: What does my user see when they first land on this page? What will they do? What happens next?

**No writing code yet**! We'll cover working together on GitHub tomorrow.

### Working with Local Storage in React

- [use-local-storage-state](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) -> You would `npm install use-local-storage-state` to use it in your code
    - Check out [this custom hook code example](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/), which shows how you could implement this yourself (you could even borrow this code and use it in your project instead of the above library if you wanted to!).
