## 🗓️ Today's topics

- Styling HTML with CSS
- CSS syntax: selectors, properties, values; shorthand properties

- The box model, margin, and padding
- Units of measurement

## ✅ TODO today

Between classes: 

Begin working on your dog adoption website. 🐕

You won't be able to do all of it at once. *Start with the html*, adding in classes for your elements. Think about how to group your elements together so you can apply styles effectively to groups of things.
