- [Response Codes With Cats](https://http.cat/)

### APIs

- [Insomnia client](https://support.insomnia.rest/article/11-getting-started)
- [GitHub API Docs](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

### AJAX, Fetch, & JSON
- [MDN AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX)
- [MDN Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- [MDN fetch() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch)
- [CSS-Tricks article on using Fetch](https://css-tricks.com/using-fetch/)
- [MDN Working with JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)

### ⭐ EXTRA/TMI

Fetch requests use JavaScript **promises** to handle responses. Promises are a _much_ bigger topic than we will get into right now, but if you want to know more about what a promise is and how to use it beyond the context of AJAX requests, you can start with the MDN documentation about it.
