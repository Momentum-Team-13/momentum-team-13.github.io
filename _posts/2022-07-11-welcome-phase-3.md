During this phase, your daily post will be specific to your section, either front-end or back-end. I'll use emojis to mark front end (🦊) or back end (🐻).

This first post is for everyone. **There are two additional posts today, one each for 🦊 front-end and for 🐻 back-end.** Scroll down to see those.

## 🕘 Schedule and Zoom changes for this phase

### 🚨 Zoom classroom link has changed

[Please use this link from now on](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88017099254?pwd=S0dXVDlNaE1wWU1uTE5mVFFDa0xoZz09). It has been updated on Slack so you can still use that bookmark at the top of the team channel.

### Team meetings are on Monday, Tuesday, & Thursday

Your team meets either during the morning or the afternoon. The rest of the day is lab time, during which you are expected to be online and working. Please let us know if you will be unavailable during work hours.

Please use lab time to **read/watch/listen to the required readings/videos/podcasts** on your daily classroom post and to **work on your lab projects**.

⚠️ And even for experienced engineers, their experience is limited to certain areas, and completely dependent on having had opportunities to develop that experience.

**What you don't know will always outweigh what you do as long as you work in a field that moves as fast as tech does**.

For an insightful take on being comfortable with what you don't know, read this great blog post by one of the most well-respected and influential JavaScript developers out there right now: **[Dan Abramov, Things I Don't Know](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/)**

## ✅ TODO for Everyone Today

- Complete this [Goals Reflection exercise]({% link goals-reflection.md %}) to re-energize for what's ahead and focus on what you want to accomplish and **post a tip from your CONTINUE list, or a request for advice for something that you've been struggling with** to our team Slack channel.

### Markdown & Taking Notes

Markdown is an easy-to-learn way to add formatting to plain text and code snippets. It is commonly used in READMEs on GitHub and can even used to generate HTML. It comes in handy a lot for developers, and you should know how to use it.

The `.md` extension indicates a Markdown file. The pages for this blog and every note in your team's `notes` repo are formatted in Markdown -- have a look on GitHub for examples!
