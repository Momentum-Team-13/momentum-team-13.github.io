## üéØ Django Music Project due Thursday @ 2:00 pm

Thursday afternoon we will not have class. You should use that time to finish work on your presentation.

## Intro to Collaboration with GitHub 

- [GitHub Collaboration Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests)
- [Git Collaboration slides](https://slides.com/amy_nc/git-collaboration/)
- [Git in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/versioncontrol) _Not everyone loves using git on the command line like I do.  A lot of folks like using the integration in VS Code, so you might want to give it a try. This is a good place to start, but there are many other extensions that you could use as well._

## ü§© End-of-Phase Presentation videos due Friday @ 5:00pm

Each person has 4-5 min to talk about one of the following topics using examples from your own code. Please record this presentation as 
you did in Phase 1 and submit using this [form](https://forms.gle/bjaPYNELkD63sdtp9) when done.


### Topics: Pick one

For all topics, **the code should be from Django Music**. If you have a different project that you want to present, or want to present on a topic not listed, please talk to me to get approval.

1. Pick any url, view, and template that you worked on. Walk through what happens _in the code_ when that url is typed into the browser's address bar (or a link with that url is clicked). You should talk about:
      - the url in urls.py
      - the view
      - any models that are involved
      - any decisions you made about how to do this or how not to do it.
      - Would you do it differently next time?
2. Tell us about a form to create objects in your application (e.g., a form to create a new Album). How does this work? You should tell us about:
      - the form class in forms.py
      - the url
      - the view
      - the template
      - Anything challenging that you had to figure out about this?
3. Explain (at least one of) your models, talking through any attributes and relationships to other models. Why did you build it this way? You could show us your database using DB Browser for SQLite, an ER Diagram that show relationships with other models, or creating or querying for model objects in the Django shell (or `shell_plus`).
4. Show a template that you worked on and explain how the code in the template works. You should tell us about:
      - the view that renders it and its view context
      - any conditional rendering in the template
      - content blocks
      - any other template tags you used and what they are doing
      - how this template is rendered in browser
5. Anything you implemented that you're jazzed about? Please tell us about it. You could touch on:
      - describe the feature from the user perspective. What does it do and why is it needed?
      - how does it work in the code?
      - did you use any libraries or packages?
      - was there anything tricky about this? what did you learn to be able to do this?

### Evaluation & starting the next phase

As with the end-of-phase of Phase 1, presentations are meant to assess what you've learned during the phase and to determine whether you are prepared to begin the next phase.

Your instructors will assess the work you‚Äôve done and determine whether you will go on to the next phase.

The criteria for passing a phase are:

- Your project is complete (it meets most, if not all, criteria in the original assignment).
- You can explain how your code works. Instructors may ask you about any portion of it and you can give a reasonable explanation.

You might be asked to repeat the phase if:

- You are unfamiliar with how your code works.
- You have nothing to present.

If we have concerns about you starting the next phase, you will hear from us on Thursday afternoon, and I'll ask you to meet with us on Friday morning. **If you have any concerns about passing the phase you are welcome to reach out to me or Jessica before then.**
