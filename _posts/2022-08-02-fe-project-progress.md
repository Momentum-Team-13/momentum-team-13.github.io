## 🗓️ Today's Topics

- Search forms and displaying results
- Uploading files

## 🎯 Project due on Thursday afternoon

Keep pushing forward! 💪 🚀

Today's class is devoted to getting you past any blockers you may be experiencing.

Minimum requirements are listed below for reference.

**Please include a README** in your project repo. The README should:

- be written in Markdown
- **include a link to your production application on Netlify**
- have instructions for getting your application running locally, so that any developer could pull it down and run it. If your setup makes any assumptions about the environment (e.g., [you should have Node.js 14.0 or higher](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/#creating-an-app) installed locally), please state them in the README.

👉 If your project meets minimum requirements today, HUZZAH! That is awesome. Are you able to add **an additional or spicy feature**?

👉 If your project does not yet meet minimum requirements, you should aim for meeting them **by the end of the day on Wednesday**.

_Note: The bullet points listed under requirements do not necessarily correspond to pages/screens. You can achieve these requirements using any design you like._
