### CSS

We need to care about the look and feel of the UI, but sometimes (like now when you are just learning React!) it makes sense to rely on a library for most or all of your styling. There are a range of libraries from the very comprehensive to the very minimal. Here are some lighter-weight ones that you could check out:

- [SmolCSS - minimal snippets](https://smolcss.dev/) You can just copy and paste these styles as needed
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/)
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
