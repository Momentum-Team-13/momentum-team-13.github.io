## Working with modules

### Step 1

Write a simple number guessing game. Your game should import [the `random` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#module-random) to generate a random integer between 1 and 20. When the program runs, it should prompt the user for a guess and then tell them if their guess was too high, too low, or correct.

_If you need an example of how to accept user input on the command line, you will find it in Jupyter notebook `03 - Input and Output`._
### Step 2

Modify your game so that it tells the user how many tries it took them to guess the right number.

### Step 3

Limit the number of tries a user has to guess the number correctly. If the user doesn't guess it in the number of tries you've limited them to, they lose.
