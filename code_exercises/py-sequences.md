## Exercise: working with sequences

Write a function that accepts one argument, a string, and counts the number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') in that string.

When you call the function with an all-lowercase string as an argument, your function should print the number of vowels in that string.

```py
countVowels('bananarama')
# prints: Vowel count: 5
```

## Where to write and run the code

You can do this a number of ways. Use whatever works for you. Here are some options:

- Create a `.py` file and write your code in there. Run the file at the command line: `python my-filename.py`
- Create a `.py` file and write your code in there. Run the file using the terminal in VS Code.
- Write and run your code in the Python REPL (just type `python` at the command line and you will see the `>>>` prompt, which will let you start typing Python).
- There is also a [Python REPL built into VS Code that you could use](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_run-selectionline-in-terminal-repl).

### Don't forget that you have to define the function AND call the function with some argument to test it.
