## Markdown & Taking Notes

Markdown is an easy-to-learn way to add formatting to plain text and code snippets. It is commonly used in READMEs on GitHub and can even be used to generate HTML. It comes in handy a lot for developers, and you should know how to use it.

The `.md` extension indicates a Markdown file. The pages for this site and every note in your team's `notes` repo are formatted in Markdown -- have a look on GitHub for examples!
