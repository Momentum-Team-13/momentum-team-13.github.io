- [Eloquent JavaScript Chapter 5: Higher Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html) - This is a pretty intense read but it includes examples of map, filter, and reduce.
- [Rebecca Murphey on using objects to write more concise code (short video)](https://youtu.be/hVQdlYgJqcY)
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) - This is a JS utility library -- lots of handy little functions that can make it easier to do common things
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) - This is a very commonly used library for working with dates in JS. It's big and kind of old, but handy for reformatting how dates are displayed. You could also check out modern alternatives like [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) or [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/).
- [Exponentially Easy Selection Sort by Vaidehi Joshi](https://medium.com/basecs/exponentially-easy-selection-sort-d7a34292b049) - A lot more about the selection sort algorithm if you're curious
We encounter tree structures in several places in the course -- like the DOM! If you want to know more about the concept of tree structures in computer science, check out this piece from [Vaidehi Joshi's BaseCS blog series](https://medium.com/basecs). She is awesome! There is also a thoroughly delightful accompanying [BaseCS podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs) with the equally amazing Saron Yitbarek.

For more info about what is happening when a browser renders a page -- very enlightening, although not strictly necessary at this stage:

- [About the browser rendering engine](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#The_rendering_engine)
- [How browser rendering works](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-browser-rendering-works-behind-the-scenes-6782b0e8fb10/)

This is a good explanation about how JS events "bubble" up the chain of elements on the page:

If you would like to know more about the JavaScript Event Loop and how it works, I highly recommend this resource. Don't miss the video of the conference talk that goes along with it -- it's excellent:
