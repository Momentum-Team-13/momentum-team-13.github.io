### ⚠️ You only need to read this post if you are on the back end team 🐻

## 🗓️ Today's Topics

- Using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with Django
- Deploying Django applications to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## 🎯 Project: Habit Tracker

You'll be working on [Habit Tracker](https://classroom.github.com/a/vE6TJEWx) this week.

It's important to read the project requirements **thoroughly** and to start to think about how you would do this project.

First steps: generate the project skeleton; make sure you are using Postgres; deploy to Heroku; and design your models. Make sure to create a diagram showing model fields and relationships. _Talk through with each other_ how you are thinking about this.

**By tomorrow**:

- Your application should be **deployed** to Heroku.
- Your **models** should be functional.
- You should be able to create habits and associated daily records in the Django shell (I recommend using `shell_plus` which is available when you have `django-extensions` installed).
