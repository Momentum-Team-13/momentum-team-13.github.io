[Beginner's Guide to React Tutorial](https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react-2020/). This will show you the most modern way to build React apps.

🚨 The video for that tutorial was taken down but the creator made a [Twitch stream of the same content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUmaTY46mYs).
