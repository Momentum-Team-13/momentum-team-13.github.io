## 🎯 Project: JavaScript Calculator

This assignment is due Monday, Feb 7.

## 🌊 Project Warm Up

Here's a warmup for the calculator.

Using [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/amygori/pen/PoOzpKx), do the following tasks:

1. When the user clicks on the box, log “CLICKED” to the console.
2. When the user clicks on the box, the box turns teal. Use the already defined CSS class “teal” and add it to the classList of the box like we did in class.
3. Now make it so that when the user clicks on the box once, it turns teal, and if clicked again it turns back to the original color. You’re adding and removing classes, and “toggle” might be helpful here.
4. Edit the HTML to show a number inside the box.
5. When the user clicks on the box, log the number to the console (there’s a console section at the bottom of CodePen that will display console.logs)
6. Edit the HTML to add a second box with a different number.
7. When the user clicks on the box, log the number of the clicked box to the console.
8. Make sure it works correctly for both boxes.

### ⭐️ EXTRA/TMI

This resource is really not at all necessary to understand or do the project, _but_ if you want to know more about the concept of tree structures in computer science, check out this piece from [Vaidehi Joshi's BaseCS blog series](https://medium.com/basecs). She is awesome! There is also a thoroughly delightful accompanying [BaseCS podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs) with the equally amazing Saron Yitbarek.

And here is more info about what is happening when a browser renders a page -- very enlightening, although not strictly necessary at this stage:

- [About the browser rendering engine](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#The_rendering_engine)
- [How browser rendering works](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-browser-rendering-works-behind-the-scenes-6782b0e8fb10/)

This is a good explanation about how JS events "bubble" up the chain of elements on the page:

If you would like to know more about the JavaScript Event Loop and how it works, I highly recommend this resource. Don't miss the video of the conference talk that goes along with it -- it's excellent:
