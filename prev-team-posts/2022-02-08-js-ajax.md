### AJAX, Fetch, & JSON

- [MDN AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX)
- [MDN Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

### ⭐ EXTRA/TMI

Fetch requests use JavaScript **promises** to handle responses. Promises are a _much_ bigger topic than we will get into right now, but if you want to know more about what a promise is and how to use it beyond the context of AJAX requests, you can start with the MDN documentation about it.
