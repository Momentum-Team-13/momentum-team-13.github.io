- [A Byte of Python: OO](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html)
- [Inheritance and Composition in Python OO](https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/)
- [OO-Programming](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/chapter15.html) -- _This is a chapter from a book called **Beyond the Basic Stuff With Python** by Al Sweigart. He has written a ton of great books on Python and makes them available to read for free online at [inventwithpython.com](https://inventwithpython.com/). You might check out [**Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). It's a fantastic beginner book._

### Classes in Python

- [Python Docs: Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)

- [Special Methods (aka magic methods) in the Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names)
- [A Guide to Python's Magic Methods](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/) _This is a great reference, but watch out! It was written for Python 2, so a few things may be different in Python 3._
