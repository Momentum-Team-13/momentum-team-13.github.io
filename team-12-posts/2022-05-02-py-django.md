## ðŸŽ¯ Project: Uptact

When you start your first dev job, you will see a lot of code all at once and will have to be able to read it and understand what it does so that you can modify and add to it.

In this project you will do just that: modify existing code to augment its functionality. This is **due Friday morning**.

Each person should accept the assignment invitation and work in their own repo, but **please work on this assignment with your assigned buddies.** Buddy groups are welcome to combine and unite forces. The point is: nobody should struggle alone.

For each part of the assignment, talk over with your buddies how you each think you can accomplish the tasks. **Be willing to try things your buddy suggests even if you aren't sure it's right!** You will learn a lot by seeing what happens (and what doesn't) when you make changes.

Talking it through will help clarify your understanding of how Django works, and having a buddy around will be helpful when you inevitably run into errors.

```py
code_buddies = [
  ('Stephen', 'Jamie', 'Manny'),
  ('Shawna', 'Gerardo'),
  ('Philip', 'Jessica'),
  ('Ambar', 'Hillary', 'Joey'),
]
```
