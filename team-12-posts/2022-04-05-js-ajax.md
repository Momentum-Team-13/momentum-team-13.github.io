## üéØ Project: Choose Your Own Adventure

Your assignment is to do _one_ of the following assignments. Whichever you choose, it will be due on Friday morning.

- üå∂ [AJAX GitHub profile](https://classroom.github.com/a/AjNfpp5A)
- üå∂üå∂ [AJAX Currency Converter](https://classroom.github.com/a/Nw7vOyEp)

## üîñ Resources

### HTTP

- [MDN: HTTP Messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages)
- [Response Codes With Cats](https://http.cat/)

### APIs

- [Illustrated Dev: Meet the Robowaiter APIs Serving Us Data](https://maggieappleton.com/api)
- [Insomnia client](https://support.insomnia.rest/article/11-getting-started)
- [GitHub API Docs](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

### AJAX, Fetch, & JSON
- [MDN AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX)
- [MDN Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- [MDN fetch() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch)
- [CSS-Tricks article on using Fetch](https://css-tricks.com/using-fetch/)
- [MDN Working with JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)

### ‚≠ê EXTRA/TMI

Fetch requests use JavaScript **promises** to handle responses. Promises are a _much_ bigger topic than we will get into right now, but if you want to know more about what a promise is and how to use it beyond the context of AJAX requests, you can start with the MDN documentation about it.
