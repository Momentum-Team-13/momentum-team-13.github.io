## üê£ End-of-phase Technical Presentations

On Thursday afternoon, Team 12 developers will each talk about some code they have written at the end of this last week of Phase 1. You can choose any JS project that we have worked on during Phase 1. You will also be doing this at the end of Phase 2 and Phase 3. The purpose is to give you practice talking about code and for you to be able to demonstrate your learning and progress.

We'll talk more about this on Wednesday. For today, read the information about [how technical presentations work]({% link technical-presentations.md %}).
