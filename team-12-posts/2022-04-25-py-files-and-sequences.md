title: Python Sequences and Files
tags: phase-2 python sequences lists tuples files
---

We can use the generic term _sequence_ for any object that provides an ordered structure for a number of items, such as a string (a group of characters), a list, or a dictionary (keys and values).

Files are important as inputs for our programs. Today we'll learn about working with text files.

## üìÖ Today's Topics

- More strings
- Working with files
- List comprehensions

### üêç Code Break

## üéØ Project

We will work on this project in stages _both inside and outside of class today_. It is due on Tuesday morning.

And these for reading the files.
