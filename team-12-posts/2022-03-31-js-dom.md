## üéØ Project: JavaScript Calculator

This assignment is due Monday, April 4.

[Link to the assignment invitation for part 1](https://classroom.github.com/a/lNO8ZU8h)

If you complete part 1, continue to part 2. 
Continue in the same repository as part 1, nothing additional to clone. You can read the instructions for 
part 2 [here](https://github.com/Momentum-Team-12/js-calculator-part-2).

##  üêà Kittens and Puppies üê∂
- Use the [notes](https://github.com/Momentum-Team-12/notes/blob/main/js-dom.md)) and the [example from class](https://codepen.io/rlconley/pen/ExowjqW) as a guide.
- The [video](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/VSMksAREm3fTCWO5uQYqupV8CpjN41QTiEHWAHff6iVzEaLT8ONc35wISKOHSyAU.0UJIHuV9VY6tzs0h) from morning class is also available, where we talk about DOM mapipulation.

- [MDN Element Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element#events) -> this is where you can see the events that are defined for elements (like "click" or "mouseover")
- [MDN Event Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) -> this is a huge list of all the available events, useful mainly to get an idea of what's possible

### ‚≠êÔ∏è EXTRA/TMI

This resource is really not at all necessary to understand or do the project, _but_ if you want to know more about the concept of tree structures in computer science, check out this piece from [Vaidehi Joshi's BaseCS blog series](https://medium.com/basecs). She is awesome! There is also a thoroughly delightful accompanying [BaseCS podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs) with the equally amazing Saron Yitbarek.

And here is more info about what is happening when a browser renders a page -- very enlightening, although not strictly necessary at this stage:

- [About the browser rendering engine](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#The_rendering_engine)
- [How browser rendering works](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-browser-rendering-works-behind-the-scenes-6782b0e8fb10/)

This is a good explanation about how JS events "bubble" up the chain of elements on the page:

- [JS Event Bubbling and Capturing](https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing)

If you would like to know more about the JavaScript Event Loop and how it works, I highly recommend this resource. Don't miss the video of the conference talk that goes along with it -- it's excellent:
